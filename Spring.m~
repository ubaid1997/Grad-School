% Using a numerical search algorithm, you have to find a design in terms of:
% • the spring wire diameter d,
% • the mean coil diameter D, and
% • the number of active coils N.

% following (customer-specific) goals as much as possible:
% • Cost,
% • Energy storage capacity (?2/8E), where ? is the bending stress and E is Young’s modulus, and
% • Space efficiency (?C/(C+1)2), where C is the spring index, C = D/d.
% A trade-off study is suggested and the problem has to be solved

% for at least  following three different prioritization scenarios ((you are welcome to add more scenarios if you want/like):
% 1) All goals have equal priority,
% 2) Cost is much more important than the other goals,
% 3) Cost has the lowest priority.

% Tasks:
% 1) Formulate a compromise Decision Support Problem representing the design optimization problem of this spring in terms
% of variables, goals, constraints, bounds, etc. organized using the keywords Given, Find, Satisfy, Minimize (see paper)
% 2) Write a computer program for solving this problem. This program should include:
% a) Goals and constraints for the model characterizing the design,
% b) A clearly separate generalizable routine for determining a lexicographic minimum. This routine should not be limited
% to the spring problem because you will need it later in the class as well.
% c) A solution scheme for finding the system variables (d, D and N) for various scenarios
% 3) Solve the problem for all listed prioritization scenarios
% a) Using an Archimedean weighting scheme, and
% b) Using the concept of the lexicographic minimum for finding a solution.
% 4) Write a technical report in which the following is documented (not necessarily in this order):
% A. A discussion on your model, solution scheme and results, which should include:
% Model:
% a) the compromise Decision Support Problem formulation
% b) your assumptions made and the reasoning behind it
% c) the (analytical) relationships used,
% d) how you have applied the principles of modeling (see lecture notes) to this problem,
% e) how you validated the model,
% Solution scheme:
% f) the solution technique(s) used,
% g) a short description with a flow chart of your program,
% Results and verification:
% h) the results for the different scenarios,
% i) your assessment of the results,
% j) how you validated the results and your solutions (include graphs, etc.),
% k) your conclusions and product recommendations,
% l) your recommendations for future work and
% m) a discussion on what you have learned from this assignment
% B. The source code of your program and examples of the program’s output.
